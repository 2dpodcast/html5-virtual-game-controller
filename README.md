HTML5 Virtual Game Controller
=============================

About
-----
This library is for easy integration of a virtual game controller overlay for HTML5 games. With HTML5, it's easy to 
get your game to run on touch-screen devices like phones and tablets, but user-input is a whole different story. With
just the accelerometer and touch to work with, it makes it hard to have a game's input pair well with the desktop version.

The HTML5 Virtual Game Controller aims to alleviate the problem with a super-simple, yet customizable option for adding a 
touch-based gamepad to your game.

Easy Setup
----------
```
<script type='text/javascript' src='/js/gamecontroller.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript'>
	$( function() { // jQuery *not* required
		GameController.init();
	} );
</script>
```
